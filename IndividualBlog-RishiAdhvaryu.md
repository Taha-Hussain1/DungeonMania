Week 5 – 
Nothing, since we were still making pairs and working on Assignment 1.

Week 6 – 
Week 6 was largely un-eventful since groups were still changing a bit. My pair became a group of 3, but then got cut down later back into a pair since one of the members dropped the course. Overall, the week was just spent reading over the spec and MVP.

Week 7
We began work properly in Week 7. Me and my partner decided to split up task 1 and have it done for this week, we it me working on Task 1 question a, b and d while he worked on c, e and f. We spent the whole week working on Task 1, discussing our problems and solutions in the Lab.
Overall, this week was fairly low effort. 
Merge requests I made were:
https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/2/diffs for part a 
https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/6 for part d

Week 8
We began on task 2 this week. I took Micro-evolution enemy goals and snakes, since I had less to do in week 7, while my partner took logic switches. While I wasn’t too frantic, I did tend to run into a couple of issues in both enemy goals and snakes. Issues mainly stemmed from my lack of understanding of the testing process I was trying to emulate and misusing certain methods and objects in testing. Eventually, I ended the week with Micro-evolution nearly done and Snakes about halfway through. I didn’t make any merge requests this week. 

Week 9
In week 9 I quickly finished Micro-evolution and continued work on Snakes. It was a bit rushed, but I managed to complete both parts and also contributed two items to task 3. Issues here were mainly from trying to parse through my snakes to make invincibility work and also to deal with trying to make tests work and check the things I need them to. I was able to work some of what I learnt from the codebase into task 3 to make sure it worked correctly.
