Week 7: 
For Task 1 I was assigned parts:
c. Inheritance Design https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/1
e. Open-Closed Goals https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/6
f. Open-Refactoring https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/7
                    https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/8
                    https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/9
I spent some time first understanding the codebase and reading the MVP and assignment spec. Then I completed both c. Inheritance Design 
and f. Open-Closed Goals as they were not too challenging.

I started Open-Refactoring during this week however due to its length I was only able to partially start working on it.

Week 8: 
I managed to complete Open-Refactoring making a total of three separate merge requests, fixing various different design flaws. 

For Task 2 I was assigned:
f. Logic Switches https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/M11C_ABRA/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/12
I started working on this task by making black box tests, then making the classes that I would work on. 
I made progress on part a of this task this week but was unable to finish it

Week 9: 
During this week I finished off part a of Logic Switches and also managed to complete part b as well. 

After completing task 2, I started working on Task 3 and made 2 merge requests for it - 
    Fixing an issue on bombs not being able to be picked after a boulder goes over them:
